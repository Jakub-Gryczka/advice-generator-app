## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScrpt
- Asynchronous JavaScript

### What I learned

This project was the first project in which I used asynchronous js. I learned about promises, async/await and fetch API. In UI I added some error states and error popup which required me to learn more about animations in js. Also it was my first time using timers in javascript.

### Continued development

I don't feel very confident in async js as well as in timers, which can be tricky when are chained or there are multiple of them.
